This Project was mad for my web development course.
I learned how to build microservices in Java usong JakartaEE for the front end and 
Spring Boot for the calculation microservices.

My main challenges were to connect the database to the microservice and also to separate every layer so they would not overlap with each other.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding this project.

The Taxwise application is a tax calculator that allows individuals to submit their income and determine the annual amount of tax to be paid or refunded, taking 
into account applicable tax credits, tax rates, and the non-taxable income threshold. It also manages personal information for each taxpayer, including their 
name and income, as well as available tax credits, with details on the description, income deduction rate, and maximum deductible amount. Additionally, the application 
integrates data related to the tax authority, such as its name and the tax-exempt income threshold, as well as information on tax brackets, including the minimum 
and maximum income amounts subject to tax and the corresponding tax rates. The annual tax amount is either positive or negative, thereby determining whether 
the taxpayer is liable for tax or entitled to a tax refund.
